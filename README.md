*Tested on windows 11 23H2 - Python 3.11 (Python 3.12 caused an error about 'distutils')*

# Setup

1. Install Python (I used 3.11)
2. Decompress the .zip
3. Use Powershell, Alacritty, or any other Terminal, to navigate to the main folder.
4. Run `python3 ./main.py` to open the python file.
5. Go to "(4) Install Dependencies"

## Reqired For Discord)
1. Go to Discord Dev Hub https://discord.com/developers/applications
2. Create a new app
3. Copy the Client ID
4. Go to "(5) Settings"
5. Set your Discord RPC ID to the one you just copied
